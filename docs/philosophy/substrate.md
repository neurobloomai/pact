# The Holistic Substrate

NeuroBloom operates from a holistic substrate.
This is not a feature. This is the nature.

## What This Means:

Holistic thinking never sits.
It flows through every primitive.
It connects every interaction.
It maintains awareness of the whole.

## How to Build With Holistic Substrate:

1. Every primitive connects to system context
2. Every action considers relationships
3. Every change ripples through connections
4. Nothing acts in isolation

This is not a primitive to implement.
This is how ALL primitives must be implemented.
